This is a simple distributed application that I built to learn more about Ethereum development tools and how they work together. The project was bootstrapped with [vtw](https://github.com/wilfreddenton/vue-truffle-webpack) a simple command line tool to generate a boilerplate distributed app.

## Install

1. `truffle compile`
2. `cd app`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`
